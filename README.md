=========

A little hack of an old rotary-dial phone with an [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html)

Heavy inspiration from [an instructable by guidomax](http://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-a-rotary-phone-dial-to-an-Arduino/)

Actually used with [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) for extended capabilities (like getting Jenkins status)
